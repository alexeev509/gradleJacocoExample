# gradleJacocoExample

This doesn't  work with JDK 15 !!! (I don't know why); But it works with JDK 11,12,13,14;<br /> 

I'm using JDK 14_0_2, Idea community 2020_2_2, gradle 6_8_3;<br />

You can clone this repository and use command: "gradle test" on Windows; (AND YOU MUST HAVE PATH VARIABLE FOR GRADLE!) <br />
On Linux this command maybe: "./gradlew test" (but i'm not sure) <br />

Or you can run this command "test" with idea user interface (for gradle) <br />

Than you can open package build->jacocoHtml->index.html (open this in google chrome); And you will see metrics in html format
